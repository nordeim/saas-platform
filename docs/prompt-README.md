Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how to re-imagine an awesome `README.md` for the new GitHub repo to host this project, one that can do justice to your amazing design embodied in your comprehensive PRD and PAD. Make sure the `README.md` is as attractive, comprehensive and informative to attract other contributors. Please add a section with a file hierarchy structing, listing key code files, also add mermaid diagrams to show app inter modules, and user and app modules interactions, also add a deployment guide with and without using docker containers (container for cross platform deployments). Then meticulously create an implementation plan for the `README.md` with integrated checklist. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it.
